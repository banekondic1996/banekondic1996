<pre>Languages that i believe are good to learn: C, Rust, Julia, Java, Python and maybe Q# for future
Rust + WebAssebly + Julia are the future with new Web Apps, of course with javascript :)
C cause it fast and direct, you can writte drivers and create whatever you want
Rust cause it future replacment for C with added benefits
Julia cause it's faster then Python for data analysis
Java cause it's flexible for things to get things done and your not bound to Windows
Python cause it's popular and easy (I don't like it because of indentions and speed, try Cython for speed)
WebAssembly is the future
What i like:
-Javascript (Angular and React)
-WASM
